# Smart Apertium
This skill uses Apertium, a free and open-source rule-based machine translation platform to provide translations for exotic and divergent languages.

## Description
Apertium is a free/open-source platform for developing rule-based machine translation systems! It is free software and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Existing machine translation systems available at present are mostly commercial or use proprietary technologies, which makes them very hard to adapt to new usages. Apertium uses a language-independent specification, to allow for the ease of contributing to Apertium, more efficient development, and enhancing the project's overall growth.

At present, Apertium has released 40 stable language pairs, delivering fast translation with reasonably intelligible results (errors are easily corrected). Being an open-source project, Apertium provides tools for potential developers to build their own language pair and contribute to the project.

This skill uses Apertium-Apy, the API of Apertium to provide the users translations that are currently available in production phase of Apertium. You can also use this skill to learn all the translations that are offered by Apertium. This skill also helps in identifying the language spoken by the user. Though, document and website translation are also some of the primary features of Apertium, they are currently under development in this skill and are going to be live soon.
